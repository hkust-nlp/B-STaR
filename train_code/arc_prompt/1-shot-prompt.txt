Your task is to answer the question below. Give step by step reasoning before you answer. 

Question: George wants to warm his hands quickly by rubbing them. Which skin surface will produce the most heat?
(A) dry palms
(B) wet palms
(C) palms covered with oil
(D) palms covered with lotion
Solution:
To determine which skin surface will produce the most heat when George rubs his hands, let's analyze each option step by step.
1. Heat Production and Friction: When two surfaces are rubbed together, the heat generated is a result of friction between those surfaces. The higher the friction, the more heat is produced.
2. Effect of Different Surface Conditions:
Dry Palms (Option A): Dry palms have a relatively high friction coefficient, as they lack any lubricants or moisture that could reduce friction. This means rubbing dry palms together would generate significant friction and, thus, more heat.
Wet Palms (Option B): Wet palms reduce friction due to the presence of water. Water acts as a lubricant, decreasing the friction between the palms, resulting in less heat production.
Palms Covered with Oil (Option C): Oil is an effective lubricant. It reduces friction significantly, which would decrease the heat produced when rubbing the palms.
Palms Covered with Lotion (Option D): Lotion, similar to oil, acts as a lubricant and reduces friction between the palms, leading to lower heat production compared to dry palms.
3. Conclusion: Since friction is highest with dry palms, they will produce the most heat when rubbed together, as no lubricants are present to reduce friction.
Final answer: (B)
